/**
 * A modifying visitor to process all references in an expression, bypassing calls
 * (and phi statements if they have been replaced by copy assignments),
 * and performing simplification on the direct parent of the expression that is modified.
 *
 * \note this is sometimes not enough! Consider changing (r+x)+K2 where x gets changed to K1.
 * Now you have (r+K1)+K2, but simplifying only the parent doesn't simplify the K1+K2.
 * Used to also propagate, but this became unwieldy with -l propagation limiting
